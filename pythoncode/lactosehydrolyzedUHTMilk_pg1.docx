In my role as a Python programmer and Solutions Architect at the Federal
Government USDA, I was part of a critical project aimed at improving
lactose-free milk for lactose-intolerant consumers. The existing methods
for analyzing the protein structures in milk were outdated, leading to
suboptimal product quality and inefficiencies in the production process.
This project required collaboration with cross-functional teams such as
physicists, scientists, engineering, stakeholders, and information
systems."

My primary responsibility was to lead the coding and analysis of data
related to the secondary structure of proteins in milk, focusing on
alpha helices and beta sheets. The goal was to enhance the stability and
functionality of lactose-free milk to meet consumer demands and improve
product quality. The challenge was to modernize the analytical methods
while ensuring the data was reliable and actionable.Data Acquisition and
Preparation: I utilized pandas to load and preprocess spectroscopy data,
ensuring data integrity and accuracy. This involved collecting and
organizing data from various reliable sources, making it ready for
analysis.

Approach to Solving the Problem To resolve this error we need to ensure
that the NumPy array contains elements of the single compatible data
type before performing operations on it. Here are the steps to approach
this problem:

Identify the mixed data types in the array. Filter or convert elements
to the compatible data type. Perform the desired operation on the
cleaned array.

I explored research books from the USDA Department of Research Library
on the Savitzky-Golay Filter and spectroscopy.  Visualization and
Reporting: Using matplotlib, I generated visual representations of the
data, highlighting the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets. These
visualizations were essential for presenting findings to stakeholders. I
also created clear and informative charts and graphs to illustrate key
findings, making it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand
the results.
